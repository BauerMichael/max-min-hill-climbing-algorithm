Description: This algorithm reconstructs Bayesian Networks from observational data. Therefor it first builds the skeleton of the DAG (directed acyclic graph) with the max-min parents and children (mmpc) algorithm. Afterwards it directs the edges between the vertices with the Bayesian Dirichlet likelihood-equivalence uniform (BDeu) score. For more information on that read the report appended or "The max-min hill-climbing Bayesian network structure learning algorithm", by Ioannis Tsamardinos, Laura E. Brown & Constantin F. Aliferis.
